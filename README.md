## Overview

Semantic_Search is designed to move beyond traditional keyword-based methods by understanding the contextual meaning behind user queries. By integrating advanced NLP models and efficient indexing algorithms, this project provides a robust, scalable solution for applications that demand high-precision search functionalityâ€”suitable for both research and production environments.

## Features

- **Context-Aware Search:** Delivers highly relevant results by interpreting the intent behind search queries.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Engineered to perform under production loads with efficient indexing and retrieval.
- **Modular Design:** Easily integrates with existing systems and is extendable to accommodate custom features.
- **Configurable Parameters:** Offers extensive options to customize search behavior, model settings, and indexing methods.
- **High Performance:** Optimized for fast query responses and low latency.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/)
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/sematic_search.git
cd sematic_search
```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running as a Standalone Service

Start the service by executing:

```bash
python app/main.py
```

This will launch the search engine on the default port (e.g., 8000). The API endpoint can then be accessed at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

### API Endpoints

#### `GET /search`

Accepts query parameters and returns a list of relevant search results.

**Parameters:**

- `q` (string): The search query.
- Additional parameters for filtering, pagination, etc., may be supported.

For detailed API usage, refer to the project documentation.

### Configuration

All configurable settings are available in the `requirements.txt` file. Configuration options include:

- **---**
  Customize these settings as required for your deployment environment.

### Examples

Below is a simple example demonstrating how to query the semantic search API:

```python
import requests

query = "machine learning breakthroughs"
response = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/search", params={"q": query})
results = response.json()

print("Search Results:")
for result in results:
    print(f"- {result['title']}: {result['snippet']}")
```
